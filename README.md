## Getting Started
### Description
When it comes to practical bruteforcing, two things are limiting the exercice: calculation power and disk space. Calculating power, thanks to nowadays GPUs, is increasing rapidly. However, a lot of disk space is required to store the huge wordlists generated by tools such as crunch. 
To avoid this problem, the Bruteslicer will manage disk space for you and cut the wordlists into parts. 

It generates wordlists within user specified limits before feeding pyrit with it to crack a ".cap" file and then clean the used wordlist. Then it generated another "slice" of the wordlist which matches size limits, before cleaning it and do it again, and again, until it reaches the end of the charset or finds a matching password.

If you exit the program before it ends, you will be able to resume from where it lefts or to re-configure another cracking session from the beginning.

### Prerequisite
* As this tool is a wrapper for pyrit, you must have pyrit installed on your system before using the Bruteslicer tool.
* Your Graphic Card, OpenCL or CUDA, must be installed and configured so that Pyrit can use it. Bruteforcing WPA without GPU is no use.
* Bruteslicer is a python script designed to run with python 2.7.
* Python modules : itertools, datetime, os, subprocess, sys, re

### Installing
* Installing the Bruteslicer is easy with git, just type : `git clone https://github.com/cmaillioux/Bruteslicer.git`
* go to the cloned folder : `cd ./Bruteslicer`
* run the script with : `python ./bruteslicer.py`

Please check the manual for detailed usage instructions.

## Manual
### Before starting
This script uses Pyrit to crack WPA handshakes. In order for the bruteforce to succeed, you must have a captured handshake in a ".cap" file. Such a file may be generated with the [aircrack-ng suite](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/).
Then, put this file ___in the same folder___ than the "bruteslicer.py" script.
